# BhFileBinder
BhFileBinder is a script that joins two executables and preserves their functionality.

## And how does it work?
It basically concatenates the executables, thus making multiple executables become one.

## And how do I use it?
First you have to have a c++ compiler, then compile it with: 
```g++ -o meu_programa.exe seu_programa.cpp``` 
After compiling it you pass the files you want to concatenate as arguments, for example: 
```one_file second_file and output filename```.
